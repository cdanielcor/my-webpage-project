    SQL

    <P>This is a hands on exercise I designed to practice the fundamentals of relational databases in MySQL. My goal was to create two connected tables and type various SQL queries to retrieve and analyze the data. I created a languages table and a products table to explore how programming languages relate to the applications built with them. The focus was on practicing CRUD operations and, most importantly, mastering different JOIN clauses to connect the data.</P>
