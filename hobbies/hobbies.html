    <h2>Learning And Living When I'm Not Working</h2>
    <p>I lead a balanced lifestyle where health, family, learning, and creativity all play an important role. I exercise three days a week with the goal of improving my blood pressure and preventing diabetic complications. Physical activity has become more than just a routine, it's a commitment to long-term well being.</p>
    <p>When my daughter is with me, we spend as much time as possible exploring together. We often visit COSI, playgrounds, trampoline parks, the zoo, Chuck-e-Cheese, aquatic parks. These moments not only create lasting memories but also keep us active and curious about the world.</p>

    <p>Outside of family time and work, I dedicate many hours to learning and practicing programming in various languages, refining my skills to become a better software developer and aspiring data scientist. I also enjoy repairing and improving my own belongings whether it's fixing my car, appliances and electronics, maintaining home, or taking care of everyday errands.</p>
    <p>Finally, I allow myself moments of relaxation, such as watching television or occasionally playing video games. These activities help me recharge and keep a healthy mental balance, so I can return to my projects and goals with renewed focus.</p>
