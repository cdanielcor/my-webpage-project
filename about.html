    <h2>More Than My Resume</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Carlos Daniel Coronel Rodriguez</strong>, a passionate software development enthusiast with foundations in C, C++, Pascal, MATLAB, and LabVIEW from my academic background. Additionally, I've gained practical experience with Visual Basic and SQL through freelance projects during my college years.</p>
    <p>My journey into <em>software engineering</em> is also driven by a deep curiosity for data, how it moves, how it tells stories, and how it powers decisions. I'm gradually exploring data science tools like Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and learning libraries used in data science workflows as I build more projects. Over time, I hope to contribute to projects where data and software come together whether in dashboards, analysis tools, or machine learning pipelines.</p>
    <p>This site was built to showcase my learning and use of multiple core web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub Pages. I'm also exploring Python, React, APIs, and backend tools to grow as a full-stack developer. Thank you for exploring it, and feel free to check out the source code or get in touch.</p>
